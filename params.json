{"name":"Pango","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.gnome.org/pango","body":"Pango is a library for layout and rendering of text, with an emphasis\r\non internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout\r\nis needed; however, most of the work on Pango so far has been done using \r\nthe GTK+ widget toolkit as a test platform. Pango forms the core of text\r\nand font handling for GTK+-2.x.\r\n\r\nPango is designed to be modular; the core Pango layout can be used\r\nwith different font backends. There are three basic backends, with\r\nmultiple options for rendering with each.\r\n\r\n - Client side fonts using the FreeType and fontconfig libraries.\r\n   Rendering can be with with Cairo or Xft libraries, or directly\r\n   to an in-memory buffer with no additional libraries.\r\n\r\n - Native fonts on Microsoft Windows using Uniscribe for complex\r\n   script handling. Rendering can be done via Cairo or directly\r\n   using the native Win32 API.\r\n\r\n - Native fonts on MacOS X with the CoreText framework, rendering via\r\n   Cairo.\r\n\r\nThe integration of Pango with Cairo (http://cairographics.org)\r\nprovides a complete solution with high quality text handling \r\nand graphics rendering.\r\n\r\nDynamically loaded modules then handle text layout for particular\r\ncombinations of script and font backend.\r\n\r\nAs well as the low level layout rendering routines, Pango includes\r\nPangoLayout, a high level driver for laying out entire blocks of text,\r\nand routines to assist in editing internationalized text.\r\n\r\nFor more information about Pango, see:\r\n\r\n http://www.pango.org/\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n============\r\n\r\nPango depends on the GLib library; more information about GLib can\r\nbe found at http://www.gtk.org/.\r\n\r\nTo use the Free Software stack backend, Pango depends on the following\r\nlibraries:\r\n\r\n  * fontconfig for font discovery (http://www.fontconfig.org),\r\n\r\n  * FreeType for font access (http://www.freetype.org),\r\n\r\n  * HarfBuzz for complex text shaping (http://www.harfbuzz.org/)\r\n\r\nCairo support depends on the Cairo library (http://cairographics.org).\r\nThe Cairo backend is the preferred backend to use Pango with and is\r\nsubject of most of the development in the future.  It has the\r\nadvantage that the same code can be used for display and printing.\r\n\r\nWe suggest using Pango with Cairo as described above, but you can also\r\ndo X-specific rendering using the Xft library. The Xft backend uses\r\nversion 2 of the Xft library to manage client side fonts. Version 2 of\r\nXft is available from http://xlibs.freedesktop.org/release/.  You'll\r\nneed the libXft package, and possibly the libXrender and renderext\r\npackages as well.  You'll also need fontconfig (see below.)\r\n\r\nInstallation of Pango on Win32 is possible, but is not documented\r\nhere. See http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/downloads.html\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n=====\r\n\r\n - By default, Pango tries to build itself so that no explicit\r\n   dependency on Xft or FreeType will be introduced in apps that\r\n   link to Pango. This is to avoid compatibility problems with\r\n   changes in the Xft or FreeType API's or ABI's. Specifying \r\n   --enable-explicit-deps or --enable-static when configuring Pango \r\n   will defeat this and should be avoided if possible.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nMost of the code of Pango is licensed under the terms of the \r\nGNU Lesser Public License (LGPL) - see the file COPYING for details.\r\n\r\nThe OpenType code in pango/opentype is derived from the FreeType \r\nproject (http://www.freetype.org) and is dual-licensed under the \r\nGNU General Public License and the FreeType license. See see\r\npango/opentype/FT-license.txt for full details of the FreeType \r\nlicense.\r\n\r\nNote that binary distributions of Pango must include a disclaimer \r\nthat the software is based in part of the work of the FreeType Team, \r\nin the distribution documentation; for instance, by including this \r\nREADME file.\r\n\r\nOwen Taylor\r\notaylor@redhat.com\r\n\r\nBehdad Esfahbod\r\nbehdad@gnome.org\r\n\r\n20 August 2012\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
